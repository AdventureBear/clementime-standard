## Overview

Clementine.js is a lightweight MEAN stack boilerplate intended for beginners and advanced users alike. 

There are 3 versions of Clementine.js:

**Beginner** - The beginner boilerplate contains a very simple application that is intended to show a beginner how the MEAN stack fits together and get started on his or her first web application.

**Advanced** - The advanced boilerplate includes a few more bells and whistles to improve workflow, but remains a simple boilerplate without much fluff to get in the way. This version of the boilerplate contains a website that demonstrates the power of the stack, including some examples of how to apply Angular & data-binding using MEAN.

**Advanced: Bare** - The bare template includes all of the additional libraries, but pared down to only include the necessities. There is a simple web app here (the same as the beginner sample), but using the additional libraries included in the advanced version.
